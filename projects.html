                <h4><b>A data science project focused on enhancing sales performance by classifying customer leads based on quality and conversion 
                potential.</b></h4><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Extracted and queried sales data from a MySQL database, followed by comprehensive data preprocessing to handle missing values, 
                    outliers, and inconsistent formats. </li>
                  <li>Performed feature analysis on key attributes such as customer location, delivery mode, lead source, lead status, and sales agent 
                    activity to evaluate their impact on lead conversion. </li>
                  <li>Built predictive classification models using Decision Tree and Random Forest ensemble techniques to categorize leads into high
                    potential and low-potential segments. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Tools Used:</b> VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, MySQL</p>
                <p><b>Accuracy Achieved:</b> 98%</p>

                <h2>Rice Leaf Disease Detection</h2>
                <h4><b>A deep learning project aimed at identifying and classifying common rice leaf diseases through image-based recognition 
                techniques.</b></h4><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Collected and organized rice leaf images infected with various diseases, splitting the dataset into structured training and testing sets. </li>
                  <li>Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture incorporating layers such as convolution, max pooling, flatten, and 
                    dense layers, and evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.  </li>
                  <li>Integrated EfficientNetB0 as a feature extractor and combined it with an XGBoost classifier, further improving classification 
                    accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.  </li>

                <h4><b>A machine learning project focused on predicting the type of skin disorder based on clinical and histopathological features.</b></h4><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Imported the skin disorder dataset into a Jupyter Notebook environment and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using data 
                    profiling techniques to understand feature distributions and correlations.  </li>
                  <li>Observed that all input features, except for age, contained categorical values ranging from 0 to 3, as they represented medical 
                    indicators from clinical and histopathological examinations. </li>
                  <li>Built and evaluated classification models using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), achieving strong accuracy 
                    scores in multiclass prediction tasks.  </li>
